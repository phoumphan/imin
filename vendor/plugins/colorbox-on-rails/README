## COLORBOX - ON RAILS ##

Written by Nicholas Young @ ArtistOne, Nashville, TN

A view helper that integrates Jack Moore's Colorbox (http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/) with your Rails application.

## USING COLORBOX ON RAILS ##

1)	Include jQuery (v1.3+) in your application.html.erb if you haven't already.

2)	Insert the following code in your application.html.erb's header portion: <%= include_colorbox_assets %>

3)	Insert links as such: <%= link_to_colorbox 'Link Text', link_path %>
	Remember, the link_to_colorbox function also accepts the standard link_to arguments as well. ;)
	
4)	Enjoy your new lightboxed content!
